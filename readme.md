## About

A large number of IDs and passwords from conferences can accumulate during remote study or work and you may admit that no one wants to search for IDs and passwords on some sheets of paper for a few seconds just before the meeting. That is why FZcode was created. You can conveniently store your data, edit it as you like or even add your own timetable.
